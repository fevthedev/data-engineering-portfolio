# My data engineering portfolio

## Just a bit about Me 💪🏾👨🏽‍💻📈
My name is Chris and I am compiling this portfolio as a testament to my increasing understanding and experience in Data engineering and analysis. I come from a web development background and this jounrey of transitioning into the data realm will be documented here. 

My goal is to acquire the fundamental knowledge and practical experience of the ETL process and eventually continue the transition into machine learning. I choose to simultaneously learn the related analytical skills so that I can relate to the end user of the data that I am managing.

I'm excited about this new chapter in my career and I'm hoping to secure full time work in the field **ASAP**!
