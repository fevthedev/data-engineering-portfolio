# My data engineering portfolio

## Just a bit about Me 💪🏾👨🏽‍💻📈
My name is Chris and I am compiling this portfolio as a testament to my increasing understanding and experience in Data engineering and analysis. I come from a web development background and this jounrey of transitioning into the data realm will be documented here. I'm excited about this new chapter in my career and I'm hoping to secure full time work in the field ASAP!
